3. Most Active Users Bar Graph: Based on number of questions created by user.



<h3>Userstories:<h3>

<h4>Userstory#1.</h4> As a user, when I go to FAQ website, I want to see a Dashboard page displaying a Bar graph of active users of this website. The user is considered more active based on number of questions he/she created.
 
<h4>Userstory#2.</h4> As a login user, when I go to my home page, I should see a question view count on Question card header.  

<h4>Userstory#3.</h4> As a user, when I go to FAQ website, I want to see a Dashboard page displaying a Line graph of most viewed questions of this website. View counter added in userstory#2 can be used to find the popularity of the questions.

<h4>Userstory#4.</h4> As a user, I want to see Donut chart showing number of answered and number of un-answered questions in the website.
